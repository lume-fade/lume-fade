                                <p>Lume & Fade is an adventurous 2D side-scroller platform game built with an empahsis on original art, sound and story to bring an experience like never before. Lume is the world that the main characters, Cur and Rynn, originally came from and Fade is the world that Cur and Rynn are currently trapped in due to unfortunate events. Both characters are trying to collect life force gems in an effort to escape Fade. Throughout the journey, Cur is able to switch back and forth between Lume and Fade, allowing him and Rynn to traverse through environmental obstacles in their way. In between levels, Cur and Rynn reminisce about their past, specifically regarding their friendship.

                            <li id="faq">What was the inspiration for this game?</li>
                                <p>With the 10 weeks time constraint given to build this game, our team wanted to build an adventurous, yet exciting new universe where the player would be able to explore and switch between two different worlds to overcome enviornmental obstacles and puzzles to find their way back home. Lume & Fade is highly fantastical with original creatures and species.</p>

                            <li id="faq">Who or what is Cur and Rynn?</li>
        
                                <p>Cur is the main character that has suddenly found himself trapped in Fade, an alternate world to the one he's known. However, in this world he finds himself reunited with his longtime friend, Rynn. Cur is part of a species known as Plark from the world of Lume that needs Luminescence in order to survive. Plarks are a plant like species that resembles reptiles. Their physical appearance consist of leaves for hair that vary in color and a brown earthy bark-tone (skintone). They can expand the growth of their limbs which also act as weapons. Culturally, they are found wearing Eidoohs, a hoodie-like sweater. 


                                <br></br>Rynn was originally also from Lume, but has found himself trapped in the world of Fade for some time now. He is surprised when he finds that his friend Cur has also found himself in similar circumstances. He is willing to do anything to help Cur return to their home world, Lume. Rynn is part of a species known as Squox that originates in the world of Lume. However, they are a very environmentally adaptable species unlike Plarks that need Luminescence to live.  Squox are a squirrel like fox with features of a bunny and claws that can be used for defensive purposes. They appear with various markings and coat colors that consist of different shades of white, cream, brown and black. See the <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> for a visual of both Cur and Rynn.</p>
